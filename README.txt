Developed using Java and Android Studio

The application consists of a single screen with an image grid, and a main toolbar showing the filter widget.

The "load images button" would load 10 images and display them in the grid.

User can enter a url of an image on the web.

If this image exists, it would be loaded and added to the bottom of the list.

Selecting an image shows an enlarged image.

Individual images can be ranked by changing the rating for the image.		

The ratings filter on the toolbar filters out the images that don't meet this rating or higher.

Changing the rating of an image would immediately be reflected in the list.


Layout is automatically switched based on device orientation
